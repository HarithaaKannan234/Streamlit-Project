## DATASET
The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 8306 samples in the training set and 2077 samples in the testing set.
The input features (x_train and x_test) have 84533 dimensions, representing the number of unique words in the dataset.
The target labels (y_train and y_test) indicate whether a text sample contains hate speech or not.
## SCORE
Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 88.30% on the test data.
From the confusion matrix:
True negatives (TN): 1834
False positives (FP): 2
False negatives (FN): 241
True positives (TP): 0
The precision, recall, and F1-score for the 'hate' class (label 1) are all 0. This indicates poor performance in identifying hate speech.
