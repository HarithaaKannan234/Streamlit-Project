Overview

    This project aims to analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
    within Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS)
    organizations. Leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data, 
    the project seeks to identify trends, evaluate conservation effectiveness, 
    and pinpoint areas for improvement. 
    The insights gained will inform data-driven strategies 
    to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

Problem Statement

    In Ontario, the Broader Public Sector (BPS) plays a significant role in energy 
    consumption and GHG emissions, contributing to environmental impact and climate change. Despite efforts
    to address sustainability, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis and actionable insights into
    BPS energy usage and GHG emissions. Therefore, the problem at hand is to leverage available data to
    thoroughly analyze energy consumption patterns and GHG emissions across BPS organizations in Ontario.

Objectives

    Identify trends in energy usage and GHG emissions across BPS organizations.
    Evaluate the effectiveness of current conservation initiatives.
    Highlight areas for improvement to achieve climate change mitigation goals.
    Present findings and insights in a clear and actionable manner.
Tools Used

    Excel: For data cleaning, manipulation, and initial analysis.
    PowerBI: For visual exploration and in-depth analysis of the cleaned data.
    PowerPoint: For presenting the process, findings, and recommendations.
Data Description

    Data is provided in separate files, each containing information on energy usage and GHG emissions.
    The data is not clean and may contain inconsistencies such as differing column headers, 
    blank fields, incorrect data entries, and technical column names.
    Understanding the units and roles of each column is essential for accurate analysis.
    Relationships across different datasets need to be established to derive meaningful insights.
Key Findings

    Toronto, London, and Ottawa consistently rank among the top three cities with the highest GHG emissions.
    School boards in Toronto exhibit the highest GHG emissions annually, highlighting the importance of sustainability measures in educational institutions.
    York University is a significant emitter of GHGs, indicating the need for sustainability initiatives within large institutions.
    Propane is the most commonly used energy source, suggesting a potential opportunity to explore cleaner alternatives.
    Regional disparities in GHG emissions exist, with cities like North Bay, Timmins, and Kapuskasing showing high emissions.
    Indoor ice rinks demonstrate significant electricity usage, indicating potential efficiency improvements in their operations.
    K-12 schools have the highest GHG emissions, natural gas usage, and electricity consumption among school boards.
Conclusion 

    GHG Emission Trends:        
         Toronto, London, and Ottawa consistently rank among the top three cities with the highest GHG emissions. This indicates the need for targeted sustainability initiatives in these areas to reduce emissions.       
    School Board Emissions: 
         School boards in Toronto consistently exhibit the highest GHG emissions annually. This highlights the importance of implementing energy efficiency measures and renewable energy solutions in educational institutions to mitigate emissions.
    York University's Contribution: 
        York University emerges as a significant emitter of GHGs, emphasizing the importance of implementing sustainability measures within large institutions to reduce environmental impact. 
     Energy Source Usage: 
        Propane emerges as the most commonly used energy source among wood, kerosene, coal, and fuel. This suggests a potential opportunity to explore cleaner and more sustainable energy alternatives.
    Regional Disparities:
        In 2012 and 2013, North Bay, Timmins, Kapuskasing, Temiskaming Shores, and Sturgeon Falls were among the top cities with high GHG emissions. This indicates the need for tailored strategies to address regional disparities in emissions.
    Electricity Usage in Ice Rinks: 
       Indoor ice rinks show a significant reliance on electricity, with a noticeable decrease in usage from 2017 onwards. This trend suggests potential efficiency improvements in ice rink operations or shifts towards more energy-efficient technologies.
    School Board Emission Profiles:
      K-12 schools demonstrate the highest GHG emissions, natural gas usage, and electricity consumption among school boards. Implementing energy conservation measures and renewable energy solutions can help mitigate emissions in educational facilities.
